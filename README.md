Some interesting notes.

-   This portfolio is written in pure HTML, CSS & JavaScript using my custom suite of  [Lucania libraries](https://github.com/lucania-software), most of which are written in TypeScript.
-   The wallpaper is using a canvas with a WebGL rendering context with some custom shader code! It can be viewed & tinkered with on  [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/cllyDs).
-   Everything else is just pure HTML using my  [lux](https://github.com/lucania-software/lux)  styling library, plus some custom CSS rules to make things look _✧ fancy ✧_.
